# US BikeShare Project using Python

In this project, i used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote codes to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The project demonstrates my  competence in employing python libraries to perform specific analyses on a rather complex data set.i used maore of conditions to merge data sets that have different column setups. I implemented a code that reads, manipulates, and analyzes data.
